# CryptoGen

Cryptogen is a customized symmetric block algorithm. Designed with teammates in TÜBİTAK BİLGEM UEKAE.

This algorithm is a genetic algorithm with a 64-bit key which can pass frequency analysis and Kasiski analysis, arranged according to the needs.
In this project : *Block the plain text in 256 bit form.  *Transpose the matrix in diagonal arrows by the key. *loop the transposition 3 times *XOR with the key in 64-bit form.
